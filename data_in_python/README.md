## Project Description

### Goal:
The purpose of this project is to perform some initial data cleanup and to do some exploratory data analysis of user and critic scores for TV shows made within the Golden Age of television.  

### Data:
The data is from IMDb and includes TV shows as well as Movies.  Included are the user and critic scores as well as the information about the genres and release year so it was possible to separate the desired TV shows based on year.

## Preprocessing Steps:
 1. Standardize column names
 2. Identify and handle missing values
 3. Identify and handle duplicate values
 4. Standardize genre implicit duplicates
 
## Conclusion:
The explorations of the data suggest user scores and critic scores have a positive correlation.
