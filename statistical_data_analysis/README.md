## Project Description:

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to explore the data and use statistical tests to answer two buisness questions and provide a confidence level for the answer. A T-test will be used

### Data:
The data for this project is from a telecom company Megaline.  There is data for 2018 on the 2 plans Megaline offers a Surf plan and an Ultimate plan.  There are 500 total users represented in the data

## Preprocessing Steps:
For each data set we will perform the three basic preprocessing stepts.  
	1. Verify and fix data types
	2. Identify and fill missing values
	3. Itnedify and remove duplicate values
 
## Data Exploration:
There are 3 main goals for the data exploration:
 1. Aggergrate the data from multiple tables to one table that has all usage data per month.
 2. Find trends per month in useage for each service offered.
 3. Calcualte the total monthly revenew per user.
 
## statistical Tests:
There are 2 hypothises to test, we will be using a T-test for both and the alpha will be 0.5%:
 1. The average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf plans are different
 2. The average revenue from users in the NY-NJ area is different from other regions.
